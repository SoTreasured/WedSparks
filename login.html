                        The colonial government laid a very bad foundation for education generally 
                        and women’s education in particular.
                           It is on record that in Nigeria, the colonial government 
                           initially did not show any interest in educational development at all.
                           The early efforts were made by the Christian missionaries who came to
                           evangelize to the people.
                           The discriminatory practice in education which favored the male over the 
                           female was very unprogressive.
                           Effort have been made to redress the situation, though not enough. (Kema, 2003).
